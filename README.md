# Youtube-video-converter-app-with-Pytube

A small Youtube video to audio converter like you see everywhere.

The code is adapted from the one sourced here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtzDjNhPZgU. It runs from PowerShell.

It is possible to change the destination location of the file by indicating the path as a parameter to .download() line 26 of the YoutubeVideoConverter.py file.

I also uploaded in the repo the source code files, which I named YouTubePythonDemo.py and YoutubeDownloadPython.py.

Comments in the code are in French, soon to be translated.
